            I live in London. It is a city full of life with a lot of people traveling from place to place. Parks are plenty and the rain is heavy.

            I live on earth. It is a planet that houses people that believe that their home is flat. There are many people with many opinions and some that don't know what they are talking about. Kinda like me with these paragraphs.

            Hello. My name is Iulain and I live in a quiet place. This may not be the biggest place I lived in but it is my current home and I like it.

            I live in London and I'm happy here but there is so much to do and so little time. Restrictions didn't make it easy, but they are gone now.

            The town I live in is nice except for the location of my house. My house is facing the wrong way round. The main entrance faces away from the road.
